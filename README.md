# 📄 Decentralized Document Verification System

A Web3-based decentralized application designed to ensure document authenticity
through cryptographic hashing and blockchain-backed verification.

This project allows users to upload documents, generate secure SHA-256 hashes,
and store those hashes on the blockchain, making the documents tamper-proof
and verifiable at any time.

It demonstrates modern Web3 development practices using Next.js (App Router),
wallet-based authentication, and Ethereum smart contract interaction via Ethers.js.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Ensures data integrity without storing documents on-chain
- Uses blockchain immutability to prevent tampering
- Demonstrates full-stack Web3 application architecture
- Suitable for real-world use cases such as:
  - Academic certificate verification
  - Legal document validation
  - Identity and credential verification

## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to showcase a practical blockchain use case
where trust, transparency, and data integrity are essential.

By storing cryptographic hashes on the blockchain instead of raw files,
the system provides a decentralized, secure, and scalable solution for
document verification.
